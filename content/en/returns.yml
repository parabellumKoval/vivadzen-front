    <li>The withdrawal period is 14 days from the day the goods are received.</li>
    <li>The customer cannot withdraw from the purchase contract if:
      <ul>
        <li>the provision of services began with their prior express consent before the withdrawal period ended and the seller informed them that they would lose the right to withdraw;</li>
        <li>the goods or services depend on financial market fluctuations beyond the seller’s control during the withdrawal period;</li>
        <li>alcoholic beverages are supplied that can be delivered after a 30-day period and whose price depends on financial market fluctuations beyond the seller’s control;</li>
        <li>goods were made to the customer’s specifications or clearly personalized;</li>
        <li>perishable goods are delivered, or goods that, after delivery, were irreversibly mixed with other products;</li>
        <li>sealed goods are delivered that are not suitable for return for health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed by the customer;</li>
        <li>audio or video recordings or computer software are delivered with damaged original packaging;</li>
        <li>newspapers, periodicals, or magazines are delivered;</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>To meet the withdrawal deadline, the customer must send a notice of withdrawal before the period expires.</li>
    <li>To withdraw from the purchase contract, the customer may use the form provided by the seller and send it to the email or postal address specified in these Terms; the seller must confirm receipt without delay.</li>
    <li>A customer who withdraws from the contract must return the goods to the seller within 14 days of withdrawal and bears the cost of returning the goods, even if the goods cannot be returned by ordinary post due to their nature.</li>
    <li>If the customer withdraws from the contract, the seller must refund all received payments, including delivery costs, without undue delay and no later than 14 days after being informed of the withdrawal, using the same payment method, unless the customer agrees to another method without extra fees.</li>

    <li>The seller is not obliged to refund the customer before receiving the goods back or before the customer proves that the goods were sent back.</li>
    <li>The customer must return the goods undamaged, unworn, clean, and, if possible, in the original packaging; the seller may offset any claim for damage to the goods against the refund.</li>
    <li>The seller may withdraw from the purchase contract if the goods are out of stock, unavailable, or if the manufacturer, importer, or supplier has stopped production or import; the seller must immediately inform the customer and refund all payments, including delivery costs, within 14 days using the same method or another agreed method.</li>
