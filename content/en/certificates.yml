  <h2>Certificates and laboratory tests of our products</h2>
  <h3>Why we test our products</h3>
  <p>From the very beginning, VivaDzen has been built on the principles of transparency and a responsible approach. That is why we regularly send all our products, especially kratom, CBD, teas, and superfoods, for independent laboratory testing in the Czech Republic.</p>
  <p>For us, this is not just a legal requirement, but above all a standard of responsibility that we adhere to at all times and without exception. We want our customers to be confident that every product they buy from us is safe, verified, and fairly traded.</p>
  <h3>What we test in the laboratory</h3>
  <p>Each batch of our products undergoes detailed analysis. We monitor the following in particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content of main alkaloids.</strong> In kratom we measure the levels of mitragynine and other alkaloids that determine its effectiveness and consistency.</li>
    <li><strong>Heavy metals and pesticides.</strong> We verify that the products do not contain dangerous amounts of lead, mercury, or other harmful substances.</li>
    <li><strong>Microbiological purity.</strong> We test for the presence of bacteria, mold, and other contaminants.</li>
    <li><strong>Other additives.</strong> We make sure that our products are pure and free of unwanted substances.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The test results are publicly available directly on this page, so every customer can view them at any time and verify their authenticity and quality.</p>
  <h3>Certification and verified quality</h3>
  <p>Thanks to our cooperation with independent certified laboratories in the Czech Republic, we can guarantee:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>100% verified origin of products.</li>
    <li>Safety for the customer.</li>
    <li>Consistent quality between batches.</li>
    <li>A fair and transparent approach.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Our certificates are not just documents; they are proof that kratom and other VivaDzen products meet the strictest safety standards.</p>
  <h3>Our philosophy</h3>
  <p>We believe that trust can only be built when customers have the opportunity to see everything with their own eyes. That is why we not only archive the test results, but also publish them regularly.</p>
  <p>If you are looking for a place where you can be sure of the safety and quality of kratom in Prague and online, then you have come to the right place. VivaDzen is a social enterprise, and fair prices plus transparency are just as important to us as the quality of our products.</p>
